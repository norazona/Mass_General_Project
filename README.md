- How many total encounters occurred each year?
- For each year, what percentage of all encounters belonged to each encounter class?
- What percentage of encounters were over 24 hours versus under 24 hours?
- How many encounters had zero payer coverage, and what percentage of total encounters does this represent?
- What are the top 10 most frequent procedures performed and the average base cost for each?
- What is the average age of each patient?
